# bf2py
## What is this?
A simple compiler that turns [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) in to Python code.

## Why?
bf2py (originally known as jjc, an awful acronym of my old GitHub username and compiler) was written as a bit of coursework for my 2nd Year Computer Science compilers module. While the current code has been cleaned up, the original code can be seen in the [original branch](https://github.com/jamieluckett/bf2py/tree/original). 

## How?
### Usage
bf2py.py input.bf [output.py]
